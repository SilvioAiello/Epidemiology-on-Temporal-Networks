EPIDEMIOLOGY ON TEMPORAL NETWORKS

The purpose of this project is to simulate epidemics on temporal networks, using Python.
Temporal networks are networks which explore different distributions of links in time, while nodes are held fixed.
Two ways of network evolution will be simulated: Dar(p) and Fitness. Also, two ways of epidemic spreading will be studied: SI and LTM.
The kind of evolution may have a deep impact in epidemic diffusion. To understand wheter, and how much, is one of the main purposes of this project.
It may be intersting to perform measures of centrality on nodes, finding those to vaccinate to prevent the spreading.
The simulation will be made more complex after acheiving the first results, for example introducing node-specific properties; so, the scripts will be written in a form as general as possible.

TODO: DEFINE DAR AND FITNESS
TODO: DEFINE SI AND LTM

This repository, at this moment, has these files:
2 directories: Examples, where some intermediate and low dimensions results will be put; Results, where the final results will go.
2 python modules, each of which simulates the temporal evolution of the network (i.e. of links between nodes) alone.
2 md files: this, and the README.
