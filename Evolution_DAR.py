#THIS MODULE ALLOWS TO UPDATE A NETWORK ACCORDING TO THE DAR(P) LAW OF EVOLUTION.
#IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S A DAR(P), CHECK THE DOCUMENTATION
#THE NETWORK IS DESCRIBED THROUGH IT'S ADIACENCY MATRIX
#EACH UPDATE IS A STOCHASTIC PROCESS, SO SEVERAL PERFORMANCES ARE NEEDED, IN ORDER TO MAKE STATISTICS
#ONLY UNDIRECTED GRAPHS WITH NO AUTO-LOOPS ARE DEALT WITH, AT THE MOMENT

### EVOLUTION

#First, an initial state is created, i.e. the adiacency matrix for T=0.
#In future development, this state will be the same for both evolutions.
#Then, it's initialized a 3D tensor, N*N*T, i.e. a sequence of adiacency matrices evolving in time.
#Each of the T adiacences matrices (A) will be updated according to the values of the previous one.
#Adiacences are kept simmetric with 0-diagonal.
#This scheme will be the same for both evolutions, just the law of updating will be different.

#In DAR, there's a probability alpha_ij of having A_ij(t) = A_ij(t-1)
#Otherwise, the new state will be extacted by a "coin toss", with probability xi_ij of getting "1"
#The evolution is performed just for the upper triangular adiancency, and than the matrix is simmetrized

    #Tensor generation, T=0 equal to initial_state
    temporal_network = np.zeros((T,N,N))
    temporal_network[0] = initial_state
    #Network update
    #First comprehension says: for each row i, taking only the upper triangle (j>i), choose the value 
    #from the same cell of the T-P matrix, with probability alpha, or from a coin tossing (whose probability of getting 1 is xi).
