# Epidemiology-on-Temporal-Networks
The purpose of this project is to simulate epidemics on temporal networks, try to correlate it to netwroks' structure, and apply results to real data, took from eMID interbank network.

A network is "temporal" when the existence of a link between two nodes depends on time: distribution of links evolves, while the number of nodes is held fixed.
Several laws of evolution exist; in this study we deal with DAR(p) and TGRG. DEFINE. Also, two ways of epidemic spreading will be studied: SI and LTM. DEFINE.

The type of netowrk evolution has a deep impact in epidemic diffusion. Understanding wheter, and how much, is one of the main purposes of this project, and can be achieved by searching (whether exists), and trying to quantify, a correlation between temporal centraility measures (DEFINE), and epidemic performances of nodes (DEFINE).

The simulation will be made more complex after acheiving the first results, for example introducing node-specific properties; so, the scripts will be written in a form as general as possible.
