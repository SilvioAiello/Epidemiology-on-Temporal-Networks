# LIST OF FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE WHOLE PROJECT OR THE SINGLE MODULES #

###			STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS 		###
TODO: PROPER VALUES FOR N,T
TODO: EXTEND TO INDIRECT GRAPH, AND ALLOW TO SWITCH
TODO: BREAK NETWORK OMOGENITY

TODO: CHECK IF ADIACENCY IS SIMMETRIC, HAS ONLY 0 AND 1, NULL DIAGONAL (BESIDES EXTENDING TO DIRECTED CASE)
TODO: VERIFY THAT IT'S A DAR/FITN

TODO: ADD "1+alfaA" COMMUNICABILITY
TODO: ADD OTHER CENTRALITY MEASURES
TODO: CHECK IF THEY ARE GOOD

TODO: FIND PROPER VALUES FOR PARAMETERS LIKE alpha,xi(DAR), phi0, phi1,epsilon (FITN)

TODO: PLOT OF DEGREE?

TODO: ALLOW TO SELECT HOW MANY DIFFERENT NETWORK REALIZATION TO PRODUCE
TODO: SHOULDN'T CENTRALITY MEASURES BE PERFORMED AND SAVED IN "EVOLUTION"?


### 		VIRULENCE CONCEPTS 			###
TODO: SET PROPER PARAMETERS TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL TEMPORAL SPREAD

TODO: PLOT OF % OF INFECTED?

TODO: TWO WAYS OF SELECTING NEW INFECTED, AS GRINDOD DID

TODO: MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO IMPORT A NETWORK, WITH ASSERTIONS ETC


### 		GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS 		###
TODO: THINK ABOUT BETTER PERFORMANCES
	(for example, propagation may do all the temporal work in one execution, and not being recalled anytime; this implies to change several collateral functions)
TODO: BETTER EXPLAIN THE WHOLE CODE (ESPECIALLY SI_PROPAGATION)
TODO: EACH NAME OF EACH VARIABLE, ALSO LOCAL VARIABLES, SHOULD BE EXPLANATORY AND NOT "a","aaa",ecc

TODO: SAVE PROPAGATION AS PANDAS DATAFRAME, CSV. MAYBE ONE CSV FOR EACH NODE 
TODO: SAVE RESULTS (SCORES, PLOTS?,	..., MAYBE IN FORM OF DICTIONARY TO CONVERT IN PANDAS)

TODO: SHOULD N,T BE PARAMETERS TO DECLARE IN FUNCTIONS?

TODO: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RANDOM SEED IN NP?
TODO: AVOID "COMPREHENSIONS" TO IMPROVE READABILITY?

TODO: LOOKUP IN SET AND DICTIONARIES IS FASTER!

TODO: IF IT WILL BE EVENTUALLY USED, DESCRIBE NETWORKX
TODO: DOES MAKING NODES "CLASSES" MAKE SENSE?
